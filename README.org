Babel functions for the [[https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq][dsq CLI tool]] by [[https://multiprocess.io][Multiprocess Labs.]] :heart:

~dsq~ is a command-line tool for running SQL queries against JSON, CSV,
Excel, Parquet, and more.

This package adds Org tables, Org quotes and Org source block results to
this list.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =ob-dsq.el=, put it in your
=load-path= and =require= it.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ob-dsq
  :ensure)
#+end_src

* Usage

~dsq~ source code blocks use the custom ~:input~ [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Using-Header-Arguments.html][header argument]] to specify
one or more data sources, then run the SQL query in the source code
block on them. Besides regular files, ~ob-dsq~ also supports Org tables,
Org quotes, Org source blocks, etc. as data sources.

The example in the above screenshot shows a ~dsq~ source block that runs a
simple SQL query spanning a JSON file named ~people.json~ an and Org table
named ~colors~.

See the [[examples][examples]] directory for a lot more features and customization
options provided by Org Babel in general and ~ob-dsq~ specifically.
